Hello my name is Ryan Schnekenburger and this is my application for assignment 2. My working title is Remember Me (probably would change if made into
a real application)

just some notes
- The learn more on the last page will take you to the alzheimer's society of Canada homepage
- I have not tested the application on my mobile device, but I made sure that the question will move underneath the picture when the window
size is decreased. I hope that counts or it works the same on a mobile device.
- I have 4 functions that I created using a click event for jquery
- most of my css was used using bootstrap but for the headers and paragraphs I wanted to have them centered so I added that to the css file
- If home is pressed in the taskbar the page will be refreshed and you will be sent to the start of the application
