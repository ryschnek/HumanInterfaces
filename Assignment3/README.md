Hello my name is Ryan Schnekenburger this is my application for Assignment 3

Please see attached my design document containg the personas and the design goals, guidelines that encouraged my design in design.pdf

In my lists you can add as many columns as you want and as many rows as you want the screen wil just be horizontally and vertically scrollable at some point

In the specification it said to not have any columns pre saved in the application but my application requires that the first column be the name of the added item 
for it to function as a table like I want to to so I dont want to give them that much freedom

This application was run using option 2 in the run options of the assignment (npm install -> npm start)
